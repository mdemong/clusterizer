# clusterizer

Here are some notes that we have about the Clusterizer:

1) To access the program, there must be a user created as in magic.php.

2) To use the program, you must Sign Up to access training and testing.

3) To access the testing functionality, the training functionality must be used to generate a model.

Enjoy!

Sincerely,
Katrina Tran, Micah Demong, Gurdev Sihra
